        description:"Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the most unpredictable filmmakers out there. He's tackled nearly every genre in film, whether it's the historical drama There Will Be Blood or his recent coming-of-age film, Licorice Pizza. It's a trait he has in common with Adam Sandler, as Sandler has mostly veered away from the sophomoric comedies that launched his career to more dramatic fare. This made the two a perfect fit, as they worked together on the romantic dramedy Punch-Drunk Love, which celebrates its 20th anniversary today. Watching this film, I was surprised at how tense it was, and how phenomenal Sandler's performance is.",

        description:"Mitchell Lichtenstein’s cult classic “Teeth” sure still has bite. As “Teeth” celebrates its 15th anniversary this year, it’s only fitting to look back on the legacy of the “vagina dentata” origin story. Written and directed by Lichtenstein, “Teeth” stars Jess Weixler as Dawn, a high school student who has committed her body to the Promise, an abstinence group that preaches on the unlawful act of sex.",

        description:"The Midnight Club hit Netflix over the weekend, and the new horror series features more than just the many familiar faces of past Mike Flanagan works. On the cast list, nestled between Flanaverse favorites like Rahul Kohli and Henry Thomas and talented up-and-comers like Ruth Codd, is one of the best scream queens of all time: actor, producer, and special makeup effects coordinator Heather Langenkamp.",
